# Shogan
Organize your TV Shows via CLI.

Because who has time to be clicking like a pleb?

# Why???
I download all my TV Shows into one folder and had to manually create different folders in another directory in order to organize them for my media server [Plex](https://plex.tv).

Well no more!!! With Shogan, i can organize my shows from the CLI, much faster, easier and look waay more cool. :sunglasses:

# Installation

Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g shogan
```

And shogan will be installed globally to your system path.
